The Good Fight Dossiers:

Prepare one for each of the Big Five who are planning (something? Reveal their intent by this point? Oh, further Hilfilma notes would possibly reveal some stuff - easy way to get across that this isn't the first time they've managed this, they just want to do a better job this time. Could also reveal stuff they've planted from day 1 (like how the Ruby Dragon escaping is all a psyop (do they know where the actual Ruby Dragon is sleeping? Unclear)))

The purpose of the dossiers is:
1) To give players a clear idea of what info is known about each of the threats
2) To provide players with ideas of how the threats can be undermined
3) To let players see the relative difficulty/threat level of the threats

To achieve 1), I need to write out most everything I think the players should know about the threats (and a little extra. TGF is good at information gathering if nothing else).
To achieve 2), I need to outline what TGF perceives as weaknesses in their setup (maybe a whole section set up as "Exploitable Weaknesses/Target Areas"), as well as potential avenues to exploit these.
	IMPORTANT HERE: It's not enough to just say "here's something we can do". I need to explicitly state "this is the end goal for this group" (e.g. for Dísian Government, the goal should be "La Cazadora and co. must no longer contain the Nexus point at the lake in which the mass teleportation and subsequent anti-paradox shield is set up"). If I just give things to do, without end goals in mind, players will feel like they're just doing things without results.
		THEREFORE, with each potential weakness to exploit, I need to outline how it MOVES THE PLAN FORWARD, how it advances towards that end goal.
To achieve 3), I need to do the inverse of 2) - show their perceived strengths and where the party might struggle. This section can also outline what approach might suit best for each of the threats - for example, overthrowing the Dísian government might be a more social approach, whereas Coven would suit better for Infiltration and Elimination of targets. In this case, Dís can be viewed as a social puzzle, and Coven as a combat puzzle. None of the threats will be solely one or another, but it'll be helpful to outline how we expect the threats to go.

An optional 4) would be Asset Allocation. In this thread, Molly would basically suggest to the party "Go out and recruit" - each NPC or group the party recruits will be considered an Asset. Assets can then be assigned specific tasks and actions to carry out while the party is away (examples are "Research into specifics of xyz", "Ingratiate yourself to government figures", "Craft magical items for us to use in future").
	Starting Assets in this case would be:
	- Molly (special skill: Weapon and Armor Crafting) (limitation: cannot leave TGF).
	- MR-01 (special skill: Combat)
	- MR-07 (special skill: Diplomacy and Deception)
	- MR-13 (special skill: Transportation)
	- Augustine (special skill: Garment Crafting)
Once the time-reversal conceit is discovered, Molly considers this an "all-hands-on-deck" priority - as many resources as possible will be diverted to assisting this goal.
Players can recruit whoever they would like to help out with these missions. I'm leaving most of this in the players hands - if they want to recruit someone, it's their job to figure out how to do so, and what tasks they would be useful for.
Important caveat for the players - if they recruit someone and decide to deploy them into the field, there is a chance that they do not return. Players must acknowledge that if they assign someone something dangerous, there is every chance that NPC dies offscreen.

TO START BUILDING THE WEBSITE:
Start with 1). In the process of outlining the info known by the group in the dossier, I should be able to identify parts of 2) and 3), which I can expand on. Once 2) and 3) are written, we have the basis for 4).
In terms of structure, each dossier should be given its own section on the site (e.g. "Dossier #1: Die Orakel Des Arcanen"). The first item in the list should be "Overview", which should contain organisational data and major characters. We can then have further pages called "Involved Party" and "Involved Group", which are individuals and groups respectively (e.g. La Cazadora as a party, Dísian Government as a group). Before these, we should have a page outlining "Knots, Fangs, and Heels" that will outline the various Knots (major issues that need to be untangled to deal with the group as a whole), Fangs (strengths that the party will need to account for) and Heels (weak spots to exploit) for the group in question. These can then have individual pages as necessary. So general structure will look like this:

#OVERVIEW#

- Who this group is
- What they provide to the Big Five
- Involved persons and groups
- Suggested approach

#KNOTS, FANGS, AND HEELS#

- List of Knots
- List of Edges
- List of Heels

#IP: Involved Person

- General details
- Place in Threat org
- Personal Threat level

#IG: Involved Group

- General details
- Place in Threat org
- Personal Threat level

#KNOT: Specific Knot

- How the knot works
- Why the knot is hard to unravel
- What unravelling the knot would achieve

#SUGGESTED COURSES#

- General overview
- What will make it possible
- What will complicate it
- What it will achieve
- How long it will take

This general structure should
