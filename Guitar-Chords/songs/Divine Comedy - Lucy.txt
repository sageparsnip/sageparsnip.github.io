I traveled among unknown men in lands beyond the sea;
C            G               F         F
Nor, England did I know till then what love I bore to thee.
C               G          F          G
'Tis past, that melancholy dream! Nor will I quit thy shore
C        G                 F       G
A second time; for I still seem to love thee more and more.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Among thy mountains did I feel the joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel beside an English fire.
By mornings showed, by nights concealed the bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field that Lucy's eye surveyed.
-----------------------------------------------------------
She dwelt among the untrodden ways beside the springs of Dove,
A Maid whom there were none to praise and very few to love:
A violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye
Fair as a star, when only one is shining in the sky.
-----------------------------------------------------------
She lived unknown, and few could know when Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave and, oh the difference to me
A slumber did my spirit seal; I had no human fears.
She seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of earthly years.
No motion has she now, no force; she neither hears nor sees;
Dm              Em              F            G                      C
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course, with rocks, and stones, and trees.
