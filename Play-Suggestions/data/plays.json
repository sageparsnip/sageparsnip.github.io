			"notes":"Written as two men, but could be done genderblind. Excellent surreal short piece about a man who falls in love with a mermaid - initially comedic but turns dark. Reads as a metaphor for depression or anxiety. Ambiguously suicidal ending.",

			"notes":"Collection of short vignettes giving insight into the lives of various individuals and couples who enter a pub over the span of an evening. Could be done as a complete collection, or could take scenes as excerpts. Very challenging as requires each actor to play 6 roles in rapid succession.",

			"notes":"Iconic piece. Challening but extremely well-written, an exploration of the deepest flaws of three of the characters in the piece. Could be seen as slightly outdated in its presentation of gender roles, but these are also exposed for their fault. Very wordy, would require three versatile actors with a strong range of emotions. Chilling read.",
